## My Github

This was a quick and dirty means of showing my branches that had open PRs against them. All other features (not many) were added "just because".

### Requirements

1. A web server
2. PHP 5.5.9 or newer
3. [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
4. [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)

### Installation

From a terminal in the web root:

1. composer install
2. npm install
3. ./node_modules/.bin/gulp

### Setup

Generate a [personal token for GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.

### License
